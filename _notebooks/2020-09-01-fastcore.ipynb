    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading a bunch of books on Advanced Python, however, like anything else, the information didn’t seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  That’s when an opportunity to help document and write tests for the python library [fastcore](https://fastcore.fast.ai/) presented itself.  For the uninitiated, [fastcore](https://fastcore.fast.ai/) is a set of modules on top of which many [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai) projects are built on. In this blog post, I'm going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why fastcore is interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:**  I’ve always heard to become a better programmer, it is beneficial to learn other languages.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools and have benifited from them, I am motivated to learn other languages.\n",
    "2. **You get a new set of pragmatic tools**: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.\n",
    "3. **Learn more about the python programming language:**  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## A whirlwind tour through fastcore\n",

    "Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention."

This is a prominent feature in some  programming languages like Julia.  For example, this is a [conceptual example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia) of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y:\n",
