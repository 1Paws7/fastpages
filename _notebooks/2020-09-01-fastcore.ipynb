    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading a bunch of books on Advanced Python, however, like anything else, the information didn’t seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  That’s when an opportunity to help document and write tests for the [python library fastcore](https://fastcore.fast.ai/) presented itself.  For the uninitiated, [fastcore](https://fastcore.fast.ai/) is a set of modules on top of which many [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai) projects are built on.  I talk more about this experience towards the end of this article.  However, I want to first tell you a bit about the library!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why fastcore is interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:**  I’ve always heard to become a better programmer, it is beneficial to learn other languages.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools and have benifited from them, I am motivated to learn other languages.\n",
    "2. **You get a new set of pragmatic tools**: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.\n",
    "3. **Learn more about the python programming language:**  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, I’m going to focus primarily on showing some highlights of my favorite tools as it relates to #2.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!\n",
    "\n",
    "## A whirlwind tour through fastcore\n",

    "Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention."

    "Contributing to an open-source is a great way to sharpen your programming skills.  If your contributions are well received by maintainers, it can also become a great mentorship opportunity.  However, many people struggle with how to contribute to open-source projects. One mistake that people often make is they jump in and try to add new features (that they perhaps need) to a project.  Nadia Eghbal, the author of the recent book [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862)\n",
    "conducted an in-depth survey of open source.  One of her observations that is relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The distribution --where one or few developers do most of the work followed by a long tail of casual contributors and many more passive users -- is now the norm, not the exception, in open source… One study found that in more than 85% of open source projects, less than 5% of the developers were responsible or over 95% of the code and social interactions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this context, it is reasonable for maintainers to view many contributions, especially those that add new features as more surface area that they alone, must maintain. No matter how well-intentioned you might be, maintainers  expect that you will not stick around after your contribution is made, unless proven otherwhise.  Therefore, I am a big believer that in order to add new functionality, you must first “make room” for it by reducing the existing maintenance burden on that project. How can you reduce the maintenance burden on a project?  Here are some ways I find found to be very effective:"

    "The above tasks tend to reduce the maintenance burden on projects, even after you leave.  An extremely high-value activity is writing tests and documentation as they force you to internalize how a piece of software works so that you may explain it to users.  Most importantly, these tasks can help you read software with an intention and deeply learn idioms, patterns, and tools that you can take elsewhere.  Finally, being a beginner can give you an advantage in writing clearer documentation that makes less assumptions about the knowledge of the reader.\n",
